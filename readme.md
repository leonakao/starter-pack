#  Starter Pack

This repo contains bash scripts to install default programs that I use on differents systems. So, when I need to use a new computer, I can install all my programs quickly.

## Elementary OS

### How to use

```
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leonakaodev/starter-pack/master/elementary/start.sh)"
```

Copy and run in your terminal

### Programs

- snap
- spotify
- firefox
- vscode
- insomnia
- docker
- github-cli
- node
- php
- composer
- volta

I suggest use the **volta** to install node and yarn afterward.
